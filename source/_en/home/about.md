# About Belich

**Belich** is an administration panel based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com){.link-out}, and that has been influenced by the documentation of [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com){.link-out}, [Laravel Collective](https://laravelcollective.com/){.link-out} and [Quickadmin](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/quickadmin){.link-out}.

The concept of **Belich**, is totally different, since the main idea is to base the development of the project on the *Back-end*, and therefore, eliminating any **javascript framework**, like [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/){.link-out}, [React](https://reactjs.org){.link-out} or even [Jquery](https://jquery.com/){.link-out}, from the equation. 

The idea is to put all the weight in the `php` part, but allowing the necessary flexibility so that each user can integrate any technology or **framework** that they want.

**And this why?** Basically, to win in simplicity. With **Belich** is very easy to customize any field or section, and all this simplicity, without having to develop complex components with **javascript frameworks**.

And of course, all the code built from scratch, and integrating the latest available technologies.

Requirements:

- php 7.4 >
- Laravel 6.x
